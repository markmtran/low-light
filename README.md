### Write-up
As a supplement to my final project, I intended to explore low-light image enhancement techniques with the following steps:

1. Pre-processing
    - Normalize the image
    - Noise Reduction
2. Enhancement
    - Contrast Enhancement
    - Sharpening
    - Brightness Adjustment
    - Exposure Compensation
3. Post-processing
    - Color Correction

I first went through the LearnOpenCV tutorial to solidify my understanding of direct kernel applications and convolutional blurs. I then transitioned to exploring other OpenCV methods that allowed me to reduce the noise in images, enhance contrast, sharpen the images, adjust their brightness, and compensate exposure. I then also tried to perform color correction on the image, but I'm currently unsuccessful as I am losing my three channels in the previous steps. However, I am able to generate some output image that looks sort of looks like some grayscale social media filter.

Although you can see additional details in the valley below, the sky seems to have degraded as well, so I would like to explore why.

I also looked into the "Contrast Enhancement Using the Laplacian-of-a-Gaussian Filter" paper by Neycenssac some more and tried to replicate their work, but I'm not quite sure what I'm getting myself into.

Here, some edges are enhanced, but much detail is lost.

### Review of Current Methods
Once youâ€™ve selected a topic or project idea, explore the literature space. Has there been academic research on this topic? Are there tutorials online, software packages, or libraries? 

Select at least 5 resources (youtube videos, papers, tutorials, opensource software, libraries, etc) and provide a short description (2-3 sentences) below: 

* Source 1: [LearnOpenCV - Image Filtering Using Convolution in OpenCV](https://learnopencv.com/image-filtering-using-convolution-in-opencv/)
    - This tutorial is a guide on how to use use 2D-convolution kernels and the OpenCV Computer Vision library to apply different blurring and sharpening techniques to an image. It also mentions bilateral filtering, which "selectively [blurs] similar intensity pixels in a neighborhood" while preserving sharper edges, and it does this by essentially changing the shape of the kernel depending on the local image content for every pixel.
      
* Source 2: [Low-light Image Enhancement via Breaking Down the Darkness](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11263-022-01667-9)
    - This paper discusses the multi-degradation of low-light images and proceeds to offer a solution capable of enhancing them by converting the RGB colorspace into a luminance-chrominance colorspace. An interesting subproblem handled by this research is the capture of images when the camera is directly opposing a light source, making the image subject particularly dark; it also discusses other methods that perform the same task, which may also be worth looking into.
      
* Source 3: [Contrast Enhancement Using the Laplacian-of-a-Gaussian Filter](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1049965283710345)
    - This paper seeks to improve the visual quality of an image by increasing the difference in intensity between neighboring pixels. It does so by applying a "Laplacian-of-a-Gaussian" (LoG) filter, which combines Gaussian smoothing with edge detection, convolving the Gaussian filter with the Laplacian filter.
      
* Source 4: [Efficient image sharpening and denoising using adaptive guided image filtering](https://ietresearch.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1049/iet-ipr.2013.0563)
    - Adaptive guided image filtering enhances edges to be as sharp as adaptive bilateral filtering, but with less computational complexity. It produces a noise-free, sharpened output without producing halo-artefacts by combining guided filter and shift-variant techniques.
      
* Source 5: [Color Image Enhancement with Saturation Adjustment Method](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11263-020-01407-x)
    - This paper discusses a multi=step framework to enhance low-light image quality: exposure adjustment, contrast enhancement, color restoration, and texture refinement. It decomposes images into two components -- illumination (for light adjustment) and reflectance (for degradation removal) -- decoupling the original space into two smaller subspaces for better regularization/learning.

Topics to explore: noise reduction filters, contrast enhancement, sharpening filters, color/saturation correction
