*Please note: The "Review of Current Methods" section's format messes up when exporting the notebook as a PDF, so I've included it below my write-up.*

### Write-up
As a supplement to my final project, I explored low-light image enhancement techniques with the following steps:

1. Pre-processing
  - Normalize the image
2. Enhancement
  - Contrast Enhancement
  - Sharpening
  - Brightness Adjustment
  - Noise Reduction
  - Exposure Compensation
3. Post-processing
  - Color Correction

### Review of Current Methods
Once youâ€™ve selected a topic or project idea, explore the literature space. Has there been academic research on this topic? Are there tutorials online, software packages, or libraries? 

Select at least 5 resources (youtube videos, papers, tutorials, opensource software, libraries, etc) and provide a short description (2-3 sentences) below: 

* Source 1: [LearnOpenCV - Image Filtering Using Convolution in OpenCV](https://learnopencv.com/image-filtering-using-convolution-in-opencv/)
    - This tutorial is a guide on how to use use 2D-convolution kernels and the OpenCV Computer Vision library to apply different blurring and sharpening techniques to an image. It also mentions bilateral filtering, which "selectively [blurs] similar intensity pixels in a neighborhood" while preserving sharper edges, and it does this by essentially changing the shape of the kernel depending on the local image content for every pixel.
      
* Source 2: [Low-light Image Enhancement via Breaking Down the Darkness](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11263-022-01667-9)
    - This paper discusses the multi-degradation of low-light images and proceeds to offer a solution capable of enhancing them by converting the RGB colorspace into a luminance-chrominance colorspace. An interesting subproblem handled by this research is the capture of images when the camera is directly opposing a light source, making the image subject particularly dark; it also discusses other methods that perform the same task, which may also be worth looking into.
      
* Source 3: [Contrast Enhancement Using the Laplacian-of-a-Gaussian Filter](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1049965283710345)
    - This paper seeks to improve the visual quality of an image by increasing the difference in intensity between neighboring pixels. It does so by applying a "Laplacian-of-a-Gaussian" (LoG) filter, which combines Gaussian smoothing with edge detection, convolving the Gaussian filter with the Laplacian filter.
      
* Source 4: [Efficient image sharpening and denoising using adaptive guided image filtering](https://ietresearch.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1049/iet-ipr.2013.0563)
    - Adaptive guided image filtering enhances edges to be as sharp as adaptive bilateral filtering, but with less computational complexity. It produces a noise-free, sharpened output without producing halo-artefacts by combining guided filter and shift-variant techniques.
      
* Source 5: [Color Image Enhancement with Saturation Adjustment Method](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11263-020-01407-x)
    - This paper discusses a multi=step framework to enhance low-light image quality: exposure adjustment, contrast enhancement, color restoration, and texture refinement. It decomposes images into two components -- illumination (for light adjustment) and reflectance (for degradation removal) -- decoupling the original space into two smaller subspaces for better regularization/learning.

Topics to explore: noise reduction filters, contrast enhancement, sharpening filters, color/saturation correction
